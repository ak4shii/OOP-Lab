1.3 Compare Swing and AWT elements

1. Top-Level Containers
- AWT:
Frame: The primary top-level container for AWT applications.
Dialog: Used for creating dialog windows(both modal and non-modal).
Applet: Used for creating applets to run in a web browser.

- Swing:
JFrame: The primary top-level container for Swing applications, a subclass of java.awt.Frame but provides more features.
JDialog: An extension of java.awt.Dialog, used for creating dialog windows in Swing
JApplet: An extension of java.applet.Applet, used for creating applets in Swing.
JWindow: A Swing container that extends java.awt.Window and provides additional features.

2. Component Class Names

AWT Class Name	     Corresponding Swing Class Name
Button	         	 JButton
Label	             JLabel
TextField	         JTextField
TextArea             JTextArea
Checkbox	 	     JCheckBox
Choice	             JComboBox
List	             JList
Canvas	         	 JPanel
Scrollbar	 	     JScrollBar
ScrollPane	 	     JScrollPane
Panel	         	 JPanel
Menu	         	 JMenu
MenuBar	         	 JMenuBar
MenuItem	 	     JMenuItem
CheckboxMenuItem	 JCheckBoxMenuItem
PopupMenu	 	     JPopupMenu

3. Event Handling
- AWT Event Handling:
AWT uses the Delegation Event Model, and Event Listeners in AWT are part of the java.awt.event package.
AWT components generate events that are handled by Event Listeners. For example, an ActionEvent from a Button is handled by an ActionListener.

- Swing Event Handling:
Swing also uses the Delegation Event Model, however, Swing extends the AWT in terms of event handling mechanism. Event Listeners are part of the javax.swing.event package as well as the java.awt.event package.
Swing provides more sophisticated event handling capabilities. For example, JButton uses an ActionListener just like Button, but Swing adds more listener types such as ChangeListener for JSlider and JSpinner.

3.1.4
We can utilize the instanceof operator in order to precisely check if a Media item implements the Playable interface and creates a "Play" button accordingly.
This operator will check whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface.
